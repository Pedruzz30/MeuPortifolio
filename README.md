This repository contains a simple portfolio site.

## Running Tests

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with jsdom to test JavaScript functionality.

Install dependencies and run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite checks that submitting the contact form displays a success message and resets the form fields.
